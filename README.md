## :man_technologist: :man_artist:

I've been learning computer science to be a hacker and painter since 2019.

I believe that if something becomes as easy as talking, you can express yourself with it and become an artist.

For me, that something is programming.



## :snake:

I am a fast learner.

My native language is Python and I do web programming with Django.

This year, I'm planning to practice JavaScript, the core language of the web front-end,

and learn a new advanced technology such as blockchain.
